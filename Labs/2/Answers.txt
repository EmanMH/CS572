Why use setimmediate and settimeout?

	When you want to run code async as soon as possible which is immediately after the running I/O queue use setImmediate 
	When you want to process code async aftet a certain delay or in the next tick you can use setTimeout
	
	
Difference between setImmediate vs Process.NextTick?

  SetImmediate postopones the execution of the callback until immediately after polling I/O while process.nextTick runs immediately after the current process execution is done, regardless which queue was being processed
